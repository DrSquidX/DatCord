This is a school project for one of my Design classes. This server is a sophisticated secure server using an SQL database to store passwords, along with sha256 password hashing which made passwords more secure. There is logging system that allows errors and communication between client and server to be displayed, and allows for easier debugging and more. There is also a room system, where people can communicate with each other, as well as a direct messaging system that allows for private messaging.
